I don’t want to be good  
I don’t want to be bad;  
I don’t want to be happy  
I don’t want to be sad;  
I don’t want to be mad  
I don’t want to be sane;  
I don’t want to be alive   
and I don't want to be dead.    

no longings, belongings   
be strong or be weak;  
don’t seek.  

can’t you see?  
I don’t want to want  
I want to be.
