_shhhhhh_  
relax  
let yourself sink in  
deep, deeeeeper  
don’t think  
you may talk, but don’t think  
no thinking!  
just sink,  
give yourself up  
melt into the nothingness of infinity  
cold, airy, free  
all boundaries of the mind  
left behind  
imploding stars, a  
sparkling supernova of life  

_shhhhhhhhh_  
relax  
don’t fight it,  
don’t fight the  
mighty emptiness, embrace  
where cold is warm and  
you is me   
and we all float orgasmically  
through the darkness  
of infinity...
